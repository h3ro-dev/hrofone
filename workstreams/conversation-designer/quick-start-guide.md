# Conversation Designer Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started with Natural Chat Experiences

This guide helps you quickly implement natural chat experiences for HR of One users.

## üìã Pre-Launch Checklist

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Review the [Intent Library](./intent-library.md) and prioritize top 10 intents
- [ ] Study the [Conversation Flow Example](./conversation-flow-example.md)
- [ ] Define your chatbot's personality and tone
- [ ] Set up development environment for conversation testing

### Week 2: Core Conversations
- [ ] Design flows for top 5 HR scenarios:
  - [ ] New employee onboarding
  - [ ] Time-off requests
  - [ ] Payroll inquiries
  - [ ] Benefits questions
  - [ ] Compliance checks
- [ ] Write sample dialogues for each scenario
- [ ] Create fallback responses for unknown intents

### Week 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Connect to HR data systems
- [ ] Implement context management
- [ ] Test conversation flows with sample data
- [ ] Gather feedback from beta users

### Week 4: Launch Preparation
- [ ] Train on final intent set
- [ ] Set up analytics tracking
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Plan phased rollout

## üíª Technical Setup

### 1. Choose Your NLU Platform
Popular options for HR chatbots:
- **Dialogflow** (Google) - Great for getting started quickly
- **Amazon Lex** - Integrates well with AWS services
- **Rasa** - Open source, more control
- **Microsoft Bot Framework** - Good for Office 365 integration

### 2. Basic Implementation Structure
```javascript
// Example conversation handler structure
class HRConversationHandler {
  async handleMessage(userMessage, context) {
    // 1. Detect intent
    const intent = await this.detectIntent(userMessage);
    
    // 2. Extract entities
    const entities = await this.extractEntities(userMessage, intent);
    
    // 3. Validate requirements
    const missingInfo = this.checkRequiredEntities(intent, entities);
    
    // 4. Generate response
    if (missingInfo.length > 0) {
      return this.askForMissingInfo(missingInfo[0], context);
    }
    
    // 5. Process action
    return this.processIntent(intent, entities, context);
  }
}
```

### 3. Essential Integrations
```yaml
required_integrations:
  - hris_system: "Employee data and org structure"
  - payroll_system: "Compensation and payment info"
  - benefits_platform: "Insurance and benefits data"
  - time_tracking: "PTO balances and requests"
  - compliance_db: "Legal requirements by location"
```

## üéØ Priority Conversations to Implement

### 1. Employee Self-Service (Start Here!)
These have highest usage and ROI:
```
- Check PTO balance
- Request time off
- View pay stubs
- Update personal info
- Benefits questions
```

### 2. Manager Tasks (Phase 2)
Common manager needs:
```
- Approve time off
- Run reports
- Add new employee
- Performance review reminders
- Team calendar view
```

### 3. Compliance & Admin (Phase 3)
Critical but less frequent:
```
- Compliance audits
- Policy updates
- Tax form generation
- Legal requirement checks
- Document management
```

## üìä Measuring Success

### Key Metrics Dashboard
```
Daily Active Users: ____
Conversations Started: ____
Successful Completions: ____% 
Average Resolution Time: ____ min
Escalation Rate: ____%
User Satisfaction: ____/5
```

### Weekly Review Questions
1. What intents had the lowest confidence scores?
2. Which conversations most often required human help?
3. What new intents are users asking for?
4. Where are users dropping off in flows?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources

### Development Tools
- **Botpress**: Visual conversation flow designer
- **Voiceflow**: Collaborative design platform  
- **Chatbase**: Analytics for chatbots
- **Botmock**: Conversation prototyping

### Testing Tools
- **Conversation unit tests**: Test individual intents
- **Flow integration tests**: Test complete scenarios
- **User acceptance testing**: Real user feedback
- **Load testing**: Ensure scalability

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This:
- Over-complicate initial flows
- Use HR jargon in responses
- Make assumptions about user intent
- Forget about error handling
- Skip the confirmation step for critical actions

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead:
- Start simple and iterate
- Use plain, friendly language
- Ask clarifying questions
- Plan for every error case
- Always confirm before making changes

## üìö Sample Code Snippets

### Intent Detection
```python
def detect_intent(user_message):
    # Clean and normalize input
    cleaned_message = preprocess(user_message)
    
    # Run through NLU model
    intent_result = nlu_model.predict(cleaned_message)
    
    # Return intent with confidence
    return {
        'intent': intent_result.intent,
        'confidence': intent_result.confidence,
        'entities': intent_result.entities
    }
```

### Context Management
```python
class ConversationContext:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.current_intent = None
        self.collected_entities = {}
        self.conversation_state = 'greeting'
        self.last_interaction = datetime.now()
    
    def update(self, intent, entities):
        self.current_intent = intent
        self.collected_entities.update(entities)
        self.last_interaction = datetime.now()
```

### Response Generation
```python
def generate_response(intent, entities, context):
    # Load response template
    template = load_template(intent)
    
    # Personalize with user data
    user_data = fetch_user_data(context.user_id)
    
    # Fill template with entities and data
    response = template.format(
        name=user_data.first_name,
        **entities
    )
    
    return response
```

## üéâ Quick Wins

### Week 1 Goals
1. **PTO Balance Check**: Implement simple balance inquiry
2. **FAQ Responses**: Set up 10 most common HR questions
3. **Greeting Flow**: Welcome message with menu options

### Success Criteria
- Users can complete at least one task without human help
- 80%+ intent recognition accuracy on implemented intents
- Positive feedback from initial test group

## üö¶ Go-Live Checklist

Before launching to all users:
- [ ] Test all critical paths with real data
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
