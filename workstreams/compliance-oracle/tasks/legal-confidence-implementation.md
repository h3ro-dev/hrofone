# Legal Confidence Feature Implementation Task

## Overview
Implement the Legal Confidence scoring system for the HR of One Compliance Oracle, providing users with real-time compliance confidence scores and actionable recommendations.

## Task Objectives
1. Create backend API endpoints for compliance assessment
2. Integrate legal confidence engine with the main application
3. Build frontend components for displaying confidence scores
4. Implement data persistence for compliance tracking
5. Set up automated compliance checks and alerts

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Backend API Development

#### Endpoints to Create:
- `POST /api/compliance/assess` - Run compliance assessment
- `GET /api/compliance/report` - Get latest compliance report
- `GET /api/compliance/history` - Get historical compliance data
- `PUT /api/compliance/check/:id` - Update individual compliance check status
- `POST /api/compliance/schedule` - Schedule automated assessments

#### Example API Response:
```json
{
  "overallScore": 85,
  "overallLevel": "medium",
  "areaScores": [...],
  "criticalIssues": [...],
  "generatedAt": "2024-06-06T12:00:00Z",
  "nextReviewDate": "2024-07-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Database Schema
